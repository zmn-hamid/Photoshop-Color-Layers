# Photoshop: Fill each layer with different color

## How does this script work?

1. You open your psd file
2. You change the FILE_NAME var in [config.py](/config.py) to match the psd file's name
3. You run this script
4. This script goes through all the layers one by one, selects the visible pixels,
   and fills them with a randomly generated and a (as) unique (as possible) color

## How to best benefit from it?

You can use the [Split to Layers script](https://photoshopscripts.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/split-to-layers/)
to split the areas into different layers, then run this script to get them be in different colors

### How was it usefull to you?

I was gonna make a AK-47 skin for CS2. I found out It's time consuming to find out
where each piece corresponds to, that's why I wrote this script So I use colors instead.
And also, manually painting all those little areas was way more time consuming.
